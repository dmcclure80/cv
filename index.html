      <p>I am interested in sustainablilty. Our Planet supports us with life in abundance. As we learn more it is apparent that humans have not maintained our responsibility to long-term survival of the eco-system. I believe that conscousness is
        raising with regard to the challenges as well as solutions; some proven and some potential. I would like to support a continueing evolution of being in balance with; whether it be our own personal issues, how we are treating each other, or
        how we treat our mother Earth and all of our fellow species.</p>

            <p><img class="image-left" width=190px; height=250px; src="images/soil-regen.JPG" alt="soil" />The United States experienced the dust Bowl 1920's due to lack of crop rotation and composting for regenerating soil. Petroleum products were
              introduced after WWII. Nitrogen and phosphates to green crops in 50's, but with
              loss of nutrients. As I was growing up in the 1950's in an agricultural area I observed the start of large corporations taking over family farms and introducing herbacides and various other sprays to the crops to control insects as
              well as weeds. By the late 60's we were having conversations about how the cancer rates were so much higher than what we experienced in our youth. As I have continued to observe the evolution of GMO plants and herbacides, I continue to
              see the
              reduction in the overall health of the population, along with the associated higher costs. I believe there is a direct coorelation between the use of GMO plants along with the herbacides and the health issues we are experiencing.
              Research
              has shown that the GMO, herbacide model is not working as the crop yields are dropping each year. There are farmers that are now changing that paradigm back towards healthy soil and organic methods that produce much higher crop yield.

            <p>The following movie is about Apricot Lane Farms: a traditional foods farm started by John and Molly Chester, a husband and wife team, who left their jobs in Los Angeles to become farmers and pursue their dream vision of starting Apricot Lane
              Farms in 2011. Located 40 miles north of Los Angeles, the farm is dedicated to the mission of creating a well-balanced eco-system and rich soils that produce nutrient-dense foods while treating the environment and the animals with
              respect.
              Apricot Lane farm residents include pigs, goats, sheep, chickens, ducks, guinea hens, horses, highland cattle, and one brown swiss dairy cow named “Maggie.” Many of which, you will meet in the BIGGEST LITTLE FARM. The land consists of Biodynamic Certified avocado and lemon orchards, a vegetable garden, pastures, and over 75 varieties of stone fruit. (Above explanation lifted from their website) <br />

              I am so excited by this clear example of the ability to turn our entire food production system to healthy sustainbable nutrient dense foods within seven years. (Highly recommend this movie / documentary with great cinematography).<br />

            <h3>Involvement Around The World</h3>
            <p>
              It is exciting that there are a number of organizations now picking up the baton to promote a sustainable future. While a number of these organizations are using methods posing enemies to draw attention to their cause there is still a
              process of raising awareness that adds value. I would prefer that organizations promote inclusive discussions with the organizations they are opposing as the first step to provide collaborative activism. Rather than being against
              anything I would like everyone to ask the question: "Is what I am about to do providing or promoting a sustainable solution for myself, my loved ones and everyone else on the planet"?"

            <h3>Healthy Aging</h3>
            <p><strong>Hugs - the most healing modality!</strong> <br /> In 2011 I learned the healing power of hugs. After a bicycle accident that left me with 14 broken bones and a mild concussion, I spent 5 days in a trauma unit, and 2 weeks in a
              rehab facility. Several weeks later I had surgery to have a plate put on top of my left collar bone.
              During recovery as I encountered others in the community I would get many hugs each day. I became convinced that these were indeed healing. My accident was on April 11, and during the second week of September I was able to do the Five
              Lakes
              Hike at Alpine Meadows in the Sierras. A five mile roundtrip hike with 1000 ft elevation gain. <br /> <a href="https://www.mindbodygreen.com/0-5756/10-Reasons-Why-We-Need-at-Least-8-Hugs-a-Day.html">10 Reasons Why We Need at Least 8

            <p>What I gathered from this is hopeful yet we need to educate as income increases so that they don't follow the western paradigm of soil destruction and poor nutrition. When people earn more $ and they can eat two bowls of rice they
              start
              down the path of ill health with sugars etc. Need variety and clean sources. See the discussion on Soil Regeneration above.</p>
