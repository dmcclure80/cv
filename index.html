      <p>I am interested in sustainablilty.  Our Planet supports us with life in abundance.  As we learn more it is apparent that humans have not maintained our responsibility to long-term survival of the eco-system.  I believe that conscousness is raising with regard to the challenges as well as solutions; some proven and some potential.  I would like to support a continueing evolution of being in balance with; whether it be our own personal issues, how we are treating each other, or how we treat our mother Earth and all of our fellow species.</p>
      <p align="center";>Investigate what is not working.<br />  Seek solutions to the problem.<br />  Educate to bring change.</p>

        <h3>Soil Regeneration</h3>
        <p>Dust Bowl 1920's due to lack of crop rotation and composting for regenerating soil.  Petrolium products after WWII.  Nitrogen and phosphates from pretrolium to green crops in 50's, but at loss of nutrients.  As I was growing up in the 1950's in an agricultural area I observed the start of large corporations taking over family farms and introducing herbacides and various other sprays to the crops to control insects as well as weeds.  By the late 60's we were having conversations about how the cancer rates were so much higher than what we experienced in our youth.  As I have continued to observe the evolution of GMO plants and herbacides, I continue to see the reduction in the overall health of the population, along with the associated higher costs.  I believe there is a direct coorelation between the use of GMO plants along with the herbacides and the health issues we are expereiencing.  Research has shown that the GMO, herbacide model is not working as the crop yields are dropping each year.  There are farmers that are now changing that paradigm back towards healthy soil and organic methods that produce much higher crop yield.  </p>

        <p>What I gathered from this is hopeful yet we need to educate as income increases so that they don't follow the western paradigm of soil destruction and poor nutrition.  When people earn more $ and they can eat two bowls of rice they start down the path of ill health with sugars etc.  Need variety and clean sources.  See the discussion on Soil Regeneration above.</p>
